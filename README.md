Functionality Overview

1. User Management & Authentication
   Implemented user login functionality, distinguishing between different user roles (admin vs. employee).
   Optionally, allow basic user management such as profile editing for employees.
   Ensure secure user authentication and session management.
2. Employee Availability
   Designed a user interface for employees to define their availability (time slots) for different days of the week.
   Consider options for recurring availability patterns, such as being available every Monday from 9 AM to 5 PM.
   Allow for easy updates and management of employee availability.
3. Shift Management
   Provided functionalities for administrators to create new shifts, specifying start and end times, required skills or roles, and optionally the associated department or team.
   Implement a visual calendar or scheduling grid for displaying available shifts and assigned employees.
   Optionally, enable drag-and-drop functionality or intuitive selection for assigning employees to shifts.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
